In this portfolio, I utilized HTML, CSS, Google Fonts, Javascript (for Parallax) and Materialize to produce an updated resume.

In the future, I would like to add more projects, and would like to center my video and text at the bottom of the homepage. 

I would also like to have a more concise resume for easy readibility.
