Christina's Portfolio

Description
In this portfolio, I utilized HTML, CSS, Google Fonts, Javascript (for Parallax) and Materialize to produce an updated resume.

Highlights
Since all I know at this point is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I tried to incorporate new styling with Materialize, utilizing the Parallax feature. 

I also linked in a more personalized video with some more information about myself, beyond what's just on my resume or tucked inside my portfolio.

For Future Reference
In the future, I would like to add more projects, and would like to center my video and text at the bottom of the homepage. I would also like to have a more concise resume for easy readibility.

Acknowledgement
Christina would like to thank everyone in his UW Coding Bootcamp class for helping improve her proficiency of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Special shoutout to instructor John Young and TA's Abdul Aziz and Ben Vaagen.
